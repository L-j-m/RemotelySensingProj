# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Hi, my name is Jiaming Li. During my undergraduate study, I was major in Architectural Environment Engineering. Basically it was being an engineer to design the heating and cooling system for a building. We did a lot of energy simulation for buildings, which aimed to further modify the building system to reduce its energy consumption while ensuring its performance.

In my current study in Urban Spatial Science course, I found a different perspective to interpret buildings. Now we can see building in a higher level, in which the group of buildings form a city. Therefore, I can improve my understanding on building as a role within an urban area.

    "text": "Introduction\nHi, my name is Jiaming Li. During my undergraduate study, I was major in Architectural Environment Engineering. Basically it was being an engineer to design the heating and cooling system for a building. We did a lot of energy simulation for buildings, which aimed to further modify the building system to reduce its energy consumption while ensuring its performance.\nIn my current study in Urban Spatial Science course, I found a different perspective to interpret buildings. Now we can see building in a higher level, in which the group of buildings form a city. Therefore, I can improve my understanding on building as a role within an urban area."

    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing, or called Earth Observation (EO), refers to obtain information from a distance. Generally, satellites or drones are typical remote sensors, which are used to acquiring data of Earth ground.\nAn advantage of remote sensing data is that it has large amount of data size, which update frequently (around every day to every 16 days). Therefore, it would be suitable for timely analysis the variation of city or building, and they could be observed in a longer time (years or decades).\n\n1.1.1 Remote sensing data\n\nSentinel:\nCollected by European Space Agency (ESA)\nLandsat\nCollected by United States Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA.\n\nFormat: generally raster.\nResolutions: spatial (pixels), spectral (bands), temporal (days, years), radiometric (the ability of detecting the radiation difference. unit: 8 bit, 11 bit).\nThe sensor detecting Earth ground relies on electromagnetic radiation, and a key character of it is the wavelength (λ). It would determine the ability of sensors that penetrate through clouds or ground layers. For instance, for longer wavelength, they are less likely to be scattered by clouds, thus they’re more likely to obtain data in a cloudy weather.\nIn terms of the data, generally they are images. The color of an image data is formed by electromagnetic, or, it is a representation of information of targets on the Earth surface. In this case, how electromagnetic is expressed by color would be essential to understand the targets on the Earth surface, and we can change the math expression of the bands to make the color have different meaning.\n\n\n1.1.2 Interacting with ground surface\n\nBidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF): It’s a function that describes the ratio of the reflectance light that viewer could receive and the source of light that illuminates the object.\n\n\n\n\nSchematic plot of reflectance, the amount of reflected light would be less or equal to the incoming light (Wynn, 2000)\n\n\nThe two types below is more about SAR data.\n\nPolarization: This refers to the deflection of signals. There are two plane of electromagnetic signal: horizontal and vertical. When the signal is polarized, the direction of electromagnetic oscillation may change.\nFluoresence: The wavelength of radiation would change after arriving the target."

The figures below show the line graph of bands:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bands have been renamed, and the wavelength of each band should be checked (see here). As every landscape has its own spectral signature, it could be used to determine the components within the POI. However, due to limit resolution and number of points, this result might not quite precise to detect the landscapes. For example, the variance of high_urban area is large, which means it contain other components addition to buildings."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nIn this week, the basic knowledge frame of remote sensing was introduced. What I found interested was the way that remote sensor works. Before, I though the sensors would work as camera, which capture information by taking picture. But in effect, the electromagnetic that emit and receive by the sensors is actually important. It is the bands that make up the message. Especially, in terms of the application of SAR sensors, it could largely ignore the weather condition, and constantly observing the Earth ground.\nSome terms that might be useful:\n\nNIR (Near-infrared, which is used to detect vegetation)\n\n\n1.3.1 Notes\nWhen doing the comparison of Sentinel and Landsat data set, the image from Sentinel should be up-scaled as the resolution of Sentinel RGB bands are 10 meter while the RGB bands from Landsat are 30 meter. When looking at the natural colors of images, we’ll use B2, B3, and B4 in blue, green, and red pipes, therefore, the those bands should be up-scaled from 10 meter to 30 meter.\nThe component of target within a pixel can be analyzed from Spectrum View (in SNAP), in which x axis is the Wavelength (nm) of bands, y axis is the percentage of reflectance."

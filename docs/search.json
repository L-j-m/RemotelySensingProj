    "text": "Introduction\nHi, my name is Jiaming Li. During my undergraduate study, I was major in Architectural Environment Engineering. Basically it was being an engineer to design the heating and cooling system for a building. We did a lot of energy simulation for buildings, which aimed to further modify the building system to reduce its energy consumption while ensuring its performance.\nIn my current study in Urban Spatial Science course, I found a different perspective to interpret buildings. Now we can see building in a higher level, in which the group of buildings form a city. Therefore, I can improve my understanding on building as a role within an urban area."

When looking at the natural colors of images, we’ll use B2, B3, and B4 in blue, green, and red pipes, therefore, the those bands should be upscaled from 10 meter to 30 meter.\nThe color of an image is formed by electromegnetic, or, it is a representation of information of targets on the Earth surface. In this case, how electromegnetic is expressed by color would be essential to understand the targets on the Earth surface, and we can change the math expression of the bands to make the color have different meaning.\nThe component of target within a pixel can be analyzed from Spectrum View, in which x axis is the Wavelength (nm) of bands, y axis is the percentage of reflectance (?). The table below shows the wavelength of each band:\n\n\n\nBand\nWavelength (nm)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nB1\n443\nUltra Blue (Coastal and Aerosol)\n\n\nB2\n490\nBlue\n\n\nB3\n560\nGreen\n\n\nB4\n665\nRed\n\n\nB5 - B8, B8a\n705 - 865\nVisible & Near Infrared (VNIR)\n\n\nB9 - B12\n940 - 2190\nShort Wave Infrared (SWIR)"

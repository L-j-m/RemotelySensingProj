# Week 1

Terms

-   NIR (Near-infrared, which is used to detect vegetation)

## Remote sensing data

-   Sentinel:

    Collected by European Space Agency (ESA)

-   Landsat

    Collected by United States Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA.

When doing the comparison of Sentinel and Landsat dataset, the image from Sentinel should be upscaled as the resolution of Sentinel RGB bands are 10 meter while the RGB bands from Landsat are 30 meter. When looking at the natural colors of images, we'll use B2, B3, and B4 in blue, green, and red pipes, therefore, the those bands should be upscaled from 10 meter to 30 meter.

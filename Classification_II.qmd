ROC: Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves

AUC: Area Under the Curve

## Summary

[Dynamic World](https://www.dynamicworld.app/explore) dataset provides nearly real time land cover data, which has 10-meter resolution (also it's an application of GEE!). This is an example of pre-trained Earth observation dataset, which might be great when it is applied in globally land cover study. However, when it is applied on locally study, it might be not accurate enough, as more specific information may need in this case. For example, in a local study the OBIA or sub pixel analysis could be applied. This may require a shapefile of local object, i.e. buildings, or spectral information in a pixel unit, etc.

### Accuracy

*Confusion matrix*, basically shows how one class may be confused for another ([Wilber, 2022](https://mlu-explain.github.io/precision-recall/)). This is used to record the performance of a classification. In stead of directly using overall accuracy, there are *Recall* and *Precision* that describe a typical accuracy more precisely. The Recall focus on preventing False Positive, while Precision focus on avoiding False Negative. This means, choosing which value get higher depends on the importance of the value, since sometimes we need to have a trade-off between them. For instance, if we want to make sure that the detection of one land cover, i.e. forest, is actually forest (high Precision, low False Positive), we may need to give up identifying a part of forest that may look less likely to be a forest (low Recall, high False Negative).

To quantify this trade-off process, we can use F1-Score to compare the overall balance of Recall and Precision. To measure and visualize the impact of the chagne of threshold, ROC plot could be helpful. Moreover, AUC could be used to compare different algorithm.

### Practical result

The figures below is the result of sub pixel analysis. I gather the endmembers by drawing polygon in the region. In the unmixing process, the figure before and after the constraint is quite different, which means the endmembers doesn't perform well and some classes cannot be found in some pixels, which leads to negative fractions ([ArcGIS](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/analyze/linear-spectral-unmixing.htm)).

By comparing two constraint level, it would be found that setting the band constraint over .7 might have better performance, as it's more similar as the sattelite image.

## Application

Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm has the advantage of processing time-constraint events. [Csillik (2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/3/243) combined RF and SLIC to improve the processing speed and accuracy of pixel-level detection. The study found that the SLIC algorithm has a higher accuracy for capturing targets comparing to traditional object-based method.

I found a review from [Maxwell, Warner, & Guillen (2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/13/2450), and they summarize the application of frequently used accuracy measurement among traditional RS and Deep Learning RS. They found that although some difference of accuracy measurement between them, for example, the DL RS researcher would use Intersection-over-Union ([IoU](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/273537/f1-dice-score-vs-iou)) to measure the accuracy, generally it is a different expression or emphasis rather than an entirely new thing. Therefore, even though neural network makes the analyzing process hard to be understanded, in an engineering perspective, as long as the accuracy is high, it could be a better algorithm.

## Reflection

The practical in this week generated lots of layers, which impressed me that there are so many way to express the information of a ground surface. Also, two continuous machine learning lectures makes me "over-fitting" --- try to memorize everything! But understanding them may take more time.

I found the accuracy measurement could be a life saver for me, since the terminologies are relatively easy to understand. Moreover, after running the classification algorithm, I can simply check the accuracy to decide whether its a good result. That's an easy workflow! However, I believe that I should try to learn more about the knowledge of machine learning, as, well, it's cool.
